<p>From Army boots to cybersecurity roots, I've spent the last two years diving headfirst into the world of security. Starting with CTFs and rapidly expanding my expertise, I balance my life as a red team operator, security engineer, and researcher with being a student and a dedicated father. Passionate about uncovering vulnerabilities as a bug bounty hunter, I'm on a mission to Hack The Planet.</p>
