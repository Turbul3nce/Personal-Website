It all started two years ago when I first dipped my toes into the world of hacking. Back then, I had a few CompTIA certifications under my belt, a bunch of solved Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and an endless, almost insatiable need to hack things. You could say I was like a kid in a candy store—except the candy was vulnerabilities, and the store was the internet.


Around this time, I was on the hunt for part-time hacking opportunities. I mean, who wouldn't want to get paid to do what they love, right? During one of my late-night internet deep dives, I stumbled upon the SynAck Red Team’s website. The moment I saw it, I knew I wanted to be part of that elite crew.

Now, I had no idea what it took to become a member, but that didn’t stop me. Without thinking twice, I submitted an application, attaching my resume and the few certs I had acquired. And then… I waited. And waited. And waited some more. All I got was a confirmation email that my application had been received. No follow-up, no feedback—just radio silence.

Fast forward a year. By now, I had landed my first gig as a Red Team operator. I was getting my hands dirty with some real-world experience, but the SynAck dream was still in the back of my mind. Around the holidays, with a bit of free time on my hands and fresh off the high of earning my OSCP, I decided to take another shot at joining SynAck.

This time, I had more credentials to back me up. I updated my resume, polished up my application, and hit submit. Surely, this time things would be different! But alas… nothing. Again, just that lonely confirmation email, like a friend who only texts you on your birthday.

After my first year as a Red Team Operator, I had leveled up. I’d learned a ton on the job, found some bugs through HackerOne, and even collected a few more certifications along the way. One night, on a whim, I decided to give it one more go with SynAck. I mean, third time's the charm, right?

To my surprise, within two days, I received an email. But this wasn’t just any email—this was the email I’d been waiting for. They thought I matched what they were looking for! Cue the excitement, the jumping around the room, and maybe a little bit of dancing. The next step was a one-way interview, where I had to record my answers to a series of questions.


And wouldn’t you know it, I got the interview email about an hour before I was supposed to leave for DEFCON. Did I panic? Of course not! I did what any rational person would do: I dropped everything, rushed through the interview in about 20 minutes, and then dashed out the door to catch my flight.

Five days later, as I was nursing my post-DEFCON exhaustion, I got another email: I had passed the interview! The next step was a background investigation. You know, just to make sure I wasn’t secretly a villain from a James Bond movie. After the investigation wrapped up, I had to wait about a week before receiving the final onboarding steps.

These final steps involved completing a series of tutorials on how to interact with the SynAck platform. Four hours later, I was done, and I fired off an email to support, letting them know I was ready.

The next day, I received the email I’d been dreaming about since the beginning of my journey: my Welcome Letter. I was officially a member of the SynAck Red Team!

Becoming part of this elite group was a long journey, full of ups and downs, but in the end, it was worth every moment. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that persistence pays off. So, if you’re on a similar path, don’t give up! Keep pushing, keep learning, and one day, you’ll find yourself at the top of that hill, looking back at how far you’ve come.
