## Echo "Hello $Hacker" | ./initiate_bugbounty 

Hello to the two or three people out there who read my posts. Pretty sure I write these for myself more than anything. It's an easy way to track progress, and I get some creative writing in-Win Win :). Anyway, to get right into it, I wanted to take some time to write a shortish post for any aspiring bug bounty hunters out there. As someone who recently got into bug hunting myself, and seeing as how the field is growing so rapidly, maybe this will help out a few newcomers. My credentials you ask? Well, what got me into bug bounty hunting in the first place was actually completing the [Bug Bounty Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-bug-bounty-hunter). By the way, great course for any aspiring penetesters and bug bounty hunters. After completing the course, I started my bug bounty journey on HackerOne. Two weekends and a bunch of hacking away on VDP programs (I do have a full time job), I had submitted 10 bugs and had 8 actually triaged. During this time, I also discovered my first zero day vulnerability (I'll write a whole other post about that, and the joy of talking with vendors or.. lack thereof.) on a COTS application (Worth a level up? possibly). Although, to be fair, this commerical application was a part of a target with a `HUGE` scope. So, I didn't really need to dedicate a ton of time into the research. 

Post about how to get into bug bounty as a complete beginner. I started Bug bounty a week ago and within that time, I have already racked up several several bugs that have been triaged. Why are you doing bug bounty? for money, to improve your resume job search, etc? Know your tools, proper training, oppertunities on Hackerone (bounty and VDP), choosing scope and expanding attack surface. targeting specififc application and where to go from there.
