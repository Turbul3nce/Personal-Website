## Echo "Hello $Hacker" | ./initiate_bugbounty 

Hello to the two or three people out there who read my posts. Pretty sure I write these for myself more than anything. It's an easy way to track progress, and I get some creative writing in-Win Win :). Anyway, to get right into it, I wanted to take some time to write a shortish post for any aspiring bug bounty hunters out there. As someone who recently got into bug hunting myself, and seeing as how the field is growing so rapidly, maybe this will help out a few newcomers. My credentials you ask? Well, what got me into bug bounty hunting in the first place was actually completing the [Bug Bounty Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-bug-bounty-hunter). By the way, great course for any aspiring penetesters and bug bounty hunters. After completing the course, I started my bug bounty journey on HackerOne. Two weekends and a bunch of hacking away on VDP programs (I do have a full time job), I had submitted 10 bugs and had 8 actually triaged. During this time, I also discovered my first zero day vulnerability (I'll write a whole other post about that, and the joy of talking with vendors or.. lack thereof.) on a COTS application (Worth a level up? possibly). Although, to be fair, this commerical application was a part of a target with a `HUGE` scope. So, I didn't really need to dedicate a ton of time into the research like some others. But enough about me. 

## Where to Start?

Let's pretend you aren't a total newbie. Say you have few hacker certification under your belt, or maybe you're even in the field and have some experience, but you're just not sure where to start in bug bounty. It's important to understand some key difference between pentesting and bug bounty hunting: 
1. This isn't a pentest, but should be treated like one. And by that, I mean be through and log everything. I'd say even more so with bug bounty hunting.
2. There is nothing quick about bug bounty hunting. You don't have 40 hours to hack this target. You are in the position real threat actors find themsevles. Take your time. You can spend weeks or even months on a single target, dpeneding on the scope.
3. There is a bit of luck in it. No matter how great of a hacker you may be, someone else may just beat you to it.
4. Go into it with a solid methodolgy that you can build upon as you hunt.
5. Bug bounty is an Easter egg hunt! Not all targets are vulnerable, and you may spend ungodly amounty of time on a target and find absoluelty nothing. And that's okay because your next target may have a bug around every corner.  
So, when first getting started in bug bounty important, it is essentail that you

Post about how to get into bug bounty as a complete beginner. I started Bug bounty a week ago and within that time, I have already racked up several several bugs that have been triaged. Why are you doing bug bounty? for money, to improve your resume job search, etc? Know your tools, proper training, oppertunities on Hackerone (bounty and VDP), choosing scope and expanding attack surface. targeting specififc application and where to go from there.
