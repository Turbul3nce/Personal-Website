Technical post about my first cve! Yay! I

I want to talk about my first ever zero day. Now it's nothing special or as cool as something like remote code execution or SQL Injection. But is is my first ever CVE and so it will hold a special place in my heart and that alone has earned it a blog post. Okay, so lets get started. What exactly is CVE-2024-*. Well as the title states, it is a blank vulnerability i the blank product by blank. In short, it allows an attacker to submit blank on behalf of blank, without any sort of authentication. This improper aauthentication is rooted in a server response that is suppose to rediect a user to the login page when they try to access it. But, what is an attacker is using a proxy of sorts. They can then intercept the 302 response which exposes the contents of the target page before redirecting. Here and attacker can capture the request, change the response and then forward it to their browser. blah blah blah.
