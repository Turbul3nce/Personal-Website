Post about how to get into bug bounty as a complete beginner. I started Bug bounty a week ago and within that time, I have already racked up several several bugs that have been triaged. Why are you doing bug bounty? for money, to improve your resume job search, etc? Know your tools, proper training, oppertunities on Hackerone (bounty and VDP), choosing scope and expanding attack surface. targeting specififc application and where to go from there.
